This book is about testing, experimenting, and playing with
language. It is a handbook of tools and techniques for taking words
apart and putting them back together again in ways that I hope are
meaningful and legitimate (or even illegitimate). This book is about
peeling back layers in search of the language-making energy of the
human spirit. It is about the gaps in meaning that we urgently need to
notice and name the places where our dreams and ideals are no
longer fulfilled by a society that has become fast-paced and hypercommercialized.
Language is meant to be a playful, ever-shifting creation but we have
been taught, and most of us continue to believe, that language must
obediently follow precisely prescribed rules that govern clear
sentence structures, specific word orders, correct spellings, and
proper pronunciations. If you make a mistake or step out of bounds
there are countless, self-appointed language experts who will
promptly push you back into safe terrain and scold you for your
errors. And in case you need reminding, there are hundreds of
dictionaries and grammar books to ensure that you remember the
“right” way to use English.
